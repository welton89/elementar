Changes in [35.0.0](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-js-sdk/releases/tag/v35.0.0) (2024-12-17)
==================================================================================================
## 🚨 BREAKING CHANGES

This release contains several breaking changes which will need code changes in your app. Most notably, `initCrypto()`
no longer exists and has been moved to `initLegacyCrypto()` in preparation for the eventual removal of Olm. You can
continue to use legacy Olm crypto for now by calling `initLegacyCrypto()` instead.

You may also need to make further changes if you use more advanced APIs. See the individual PRs (listed in order of size of change) for specific APIs changed and how to migrate.
